- 25/09/2005, version 0.0.3: roms
	- modified TiEmu virtual link for Windows: don't use .shared section 
	any more. This breaks compat with older revision of the library but 
	we are still in beta stage.
	- "fixed" TiEmu virtual link for Linux: it seems it has never been
	used/tested because it was un-finished ?!

====[ Version II ]====

- 05/03/2005, version 3.8.9: roms
	Added gcc 4.0 -fvisibility flag support.
	Fixed getting of current handle in VTi link support with MinGW.

- 09/02/2005, version 3.8.8: roms
	Some clean-up and fixes in the virtual link cables.
	Removed windows.h dependancy in timeout.h.
	Fixed some MinGw compilation issues.

- 25/09/2004, version 3.8.7: roms
	Added USB direct cable support (kernel module).
	Added USB direct cable support (lib-usb).
	
- 11/06/2004, version 3.8.6: jb
	Added support for x86-64 (configure.ac, configure).

- 22/05/2004, version 3.8.6: roms
	Bug fixes from JB: buffer overflow in linux_detect.c, NULL functions
	with direct link support.
	
- 05/05/2004, version 3.8.5: roms
	Bug fix in the verbose.c compatibility support (DISPLAY).
	Merged Tijl's patch: does not build or use libusb support if libusb
	not detected.
	link_dfl changed into link_nul (null cable). Added null method and null
	port in order to implement a pure null cable.
	Default settings are now set to a null cable/port.
	
- 24/04/2004, version 3.8.4: roms
	Added buffered write support to the SilverLink / Win32 module. 
	Driver 3.0.2.1 is needed. Tested with various transfers.

- 21/04/2004, version 3.8.3: roms
	Added full/partial BUFFERED_W (heuristic) support to get the best of
	both worlds ! Tested with group, idlist, clock, backup, 
	FLASH apps (s/r), ROM dump and FLASH os.
	This really speed-up FLASH app transfer (sending).
	Done the same work for tiglusb kernel module support. This stuff will 
	be moved into the module later...
	
- 17/04/2004, version 3.8.2: roms
	Bug in lib-usb support: wrong timeout passed to libusb (1/10 of
	value) => short timeout !
	Discovered the same bug in tipar/tiser/tiusb kernel module !

	Note: USB support default behaviour is: BUFFERED_R=1 & BUFFERED_W=0.
	Using BUFFERED_W make FLASH sending faster but communication is less 
	reliable.
	
- 08/04/2004, version 3.8.1: roms
	Redirection of stdout/stderr.
	Weird: we were using tilp/ticable.h. It should be linux/ticable.h.
	In fact, modules use tilp/ but built-in uses linux/.
	Modules will be modified to linux/.
	
- 22/03/2004, version 3.8.0: roms
	Splitted sources according to target and cables.
	Tested under Linux with:
	- GreyLink: api: ok
	- BlackLink: asm: ok, ioctl: ok, module: ?? 
	- SilverLink: ioctl: ok, module: ok
	- Parallel: asm: ??, module: ??
	Wake-up sequence removed from serial & parallel cables because it 
	perturbates communication start-up.
	
	Beware: Mac OS-X support has been moved to the new architecture but 
	has not been compiled !!!

	Bug in serial link support (mode asm: no timeout on ser_get).
	Bug in parallel link support (mode asm: no timeout on par_get).

	Added ability to immediately flush log file to disk.

- 14/02/2002, version 3.1.4:
	Merge with Mac OS-X: building projects are in 'osx'.
	
- 13/02/2002, version 3.1.3:
	Replaced some code by macros in tpu_link. & vti_link.c
	Added a new structure and method for computing data rate.
	
- 12/02/2002, version 3.1.2:

	Html doc updated. Minor fixes for Win32.
	
- 31/12/2001, version 3.0.7:
	intrface.c cleaned. 
	TIGL-USB support with libusb works very fine now.
	TIGL-USB support with kernel module improved. It works fine but if a
	transfer is cancelled, we need to reload the kernel module or re-plug 
	the link cable.
	Error codes have been improved (more explicit).

	I have changed the naming scheme about the LinkCable structure.
	I have cleaned up the source code.
	Moved pause.h from libticables to libticalcs.
	
- 21/12/2001, version 2.2.4 -> 3.0.1:
	I have changed my motherboard (SiS + Duron800MHz) which have been
	broken by my brother. I have finished the I/O management.
	ugl_link.c: libusb and kernel module support splitted.
	Compiled and fixed for Win32.
	
- 18/12/2001, version 2.2.3 -> 3.0.0:
	I have increased the major number: I have planned many enhancements, 
	modifications, clean-up, ...
	
	I/O management and probing improved.
	I have added 2 new functions: ticable_init & ticable_exit. The first 
	one is primarily used for detecting & listing available I/O routines.
	This version is still backward compatible if the 
	ticable_get_default_param function is called (and it should be...).
	
- 17/12/2001, version 2.2.2:
	JB has written a support of the SilverLink (TIGL-USB) with the libusb.
	I have merged his patch.
	ticable_probe: I have added a check for mouse (no risk to hang up your
	mouse, at least under Linux).
	
- 11/12/2001, version 2.2.1:
	Consistency: ticable_set_param modified again: use a struct but
	ticable_set_param2 use a pointer on structure.
	
- 20/11/2001, version 2.2.0:
	Win32 projects are now distributed with source code.
	get_default_param returns a GreyTIGL link cable on COM2.
	
- 19/11/2001, version 2.1.9:
	French PO files have been updated (i18n).
	Tested under WindowsXP with success ! WindowsXP seems to be a NT based
	system rather than a Windows9x/Me system.
	
- 17/11/2001, version 2.1.8:
	Recompiled under Win32.
	
- 15/11/2001, version 2.1.7:
	Consistency: ticable_set_param use a pointer on struct now.
	
- 08/11/2001, version 2.1.6:
	Added a m4 macro for checking libticables in configure scripts.

	directly use a parallel/serial link cable.
	
- 19/10/2001, version 2.1.3:
	Updated to Am/Ac2.52: configure.in renamed into configure.ac.

	Some missing error codes have been added.
	
- 17/10/2001, version 2.1.1:
	Logging mechanism improved (logging.*).
	After some tests, it seems that transfer are more reliable if we
	send byte per byte rather than per packet. I think (an hypothesis) that
	we should not try to get data if link cable's buffer does not contain
	data.
	By sending byte per byte, we ensure a fast reply of the calc and so
	we ensure that link cable's reading buffer are not empty.
	
- 16/10/2001, version 2.1.0:
	TIGL-USB Linux support improved. There is still one problem: receiving
	variables by block crashes. Else, all other things work (ready, screen,
	send vars, backup, ...)
	
- 13/10/2001, version 2.0.9:
	I have written the TIGL-USB Linux support for testing the device
	driver.
	Read & write operations are buffered.
	The TIGL-USB Linux kernel driver works fine but it is a bit slow...

- 12/10/2001, version 2.0.8:
	The TIGL-USB Win32 kernel driver works fine now. I have merged Win32
	support. Note: this version is not very clean because it includes
	some kernel definitions & exports as well as a DDK library.
	To do: write a DLL front-end and package it.
	The library manages only 1 USB link cable. A future version will be
	able to manage up to 4 USB link cables.
	
- 06/10/2001, version 2.0.7:
	The TIGL-USB Win32 kernel driver is under development.
	
- 30/09/2001, version 2.0.6:
	The TIGL-USB linux kernel driver works ! JB has chosen the 
	following nodes: /dev/usb/tigl[0-15] so I have modified the lib
	consequently.
	
- 29/09/2001, version 2.0.5:
	TIGL-USB support added.
	
- 17/09/2001, version 2.0.4:
	Routines for probing ports/cables have been fixed (many bugs under 
	Linux).
	Thing to fix: if a mouse is connected on a serial port, the probing
	routine hang-up the mouse...
	Anyways, these routines need to be cleaned, improved and securized.
	
- 14/09/2001, version 2.0.3:
	The test program have been tested on Win32 platforms.
	I have added a check in ticable_set_cable: user is informed if he
	tries to use a port which is not compatible with the cable.
	The cabl_int.h file has been completed. It contains now all exported
	functions.
	I have removed many warnings under MSVC (none to level3).
	
- 13/09/2001, version 2.0.2:
	I have tested the library under Win32 (9x/NT).
	The library is now stable and clean.
	Doc has not been updated yet.
	Headers are now C++ compliant (extern "C").
	Thomas Wolf <two@chello.at> has written a BCC32 v5.x (or C++Builder5+)
	wrapper for the libticables. He has also bring about some modifications
	to the libticables that I have merged.
	
- 12/09/2001, version 2.0.1:
	I have widely cleaned up I/O management, interface and headers.
	I have also removed old routines.
	
- 11/09/2001, version 2.0.0: compatibility broken -> v2.x.x
	library is now easier to use: simply pass the port to use (a name)
	and the lib find device name & address.
	The library is backward compatible with programs which use the old
	library. Nethertheless, programs need to be recompiled.
	
- 10/09/2001, version 1.8.5: a bug fix in the dev string (too short).
	Some modifications for making the lib easier to use.

- 02/06/2001, version 1.7.7: some functions for managing raw access have been added as well as functions for checking sending/receiving. They have been added for making easy emulator support which can require a direct access.
	
- 19/05/2001, version 1.7.6: VTi link support improved and modified. TIEmulator virtual link re-implemented under Win32. Some code have been cleaned.
