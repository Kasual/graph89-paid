This library is part of the TILP framework by Romain Liévin et al.

See the AUTHORS file for more detailed authorship information.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OS:
  - any *nix with a reasonably modern C compiler (a current GCC will definitely
    work)
    See the CONFIG file for device permission issues and how to solve them.
  or
  - Microsoft Windows, MSVC or MSYS+MinGW required for compiling from source

Libraries:
  - GLib 2 (required)
  - libusb 0.1 or libusb 1.0 on *nix, or libusb-win32 (optional, required to use
    USB cables)

Tools for building from source:
  - make (required)
  - tfdocgen (optional, required to build API docs)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compilation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Untar the libticables2 archive, change directory to the libticables2
directory.

Type "./configure" (add --prefix option to install to a non-default location).
Add --enable-libusb10 if you want to build against the libusb 1.0 backend,
which will become default in the future.

Type "make" and then "make install". "make install" requires root privileges
to install to the default, system-wide location.

NOTE: some cable handlers can be disabled using #define NO_CABLE_XXX.

NOTE: building libticables against the libusb 1.0 compatibility layer for
libusb 0.1 does not work, because some features required by libticables are
not supported by this compatibility layer. You need to build either against
libusb 0.1 proper, or use the libusb 1.0 backend.

NOTE: on *nix, see the CONFIG file for device permission issues and how to
solve them.
