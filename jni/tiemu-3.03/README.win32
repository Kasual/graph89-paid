				*     TiEmu	*
				* Win32 version *
				*****************



REQUIREMENTS
------------

 - a PC with a 450MHz Pentium-class processor and 32MB of RAM
 - a Windows computer: Windows 95/98/Me or Windows NT4/2000/XP/Vista (better)
 - the GTK+ 2.6 libraries
    Location: <http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gladewin32/gtk-win32-2.6.8-rc1.exe?download>
	
Note: if you are using 'The GiMP', you may encounter DLL's problems...
		The GTK+ package (1) provided with the GiMP may not be fully compatible with one used by TiLP/TiEmu.
		On the other hand, the package (2) requested by TiLP/TiEmu is compatible with the GiMP.
		Thus, if you are using The GiMP, you are strongly encouraged to uninstall (1) and install (2).


NOTES
-----

1°) This setup may download & install some extra libraries (GTK+ 2.6). 

The GTK+ package includes the Wimp (Windows IMPersonator) theme engine which gives 
Windows look & feel (includes XP theming). Is also included the GTK theme selector.
You may need to use it on non-NT systems if you get a lot of warnings about a font. 
Simply disable the WiMP theme for another one.

2°) If anyone is getting one of these:
- ** WARNING **: Couldn't load font "MS Sans Serif 8" falling back to "Sans 8"
- ** ERROR **: file shape.c line 75: assertion failed: (glyphs->num_glyphs > 0)
or any other warning or error message regarding fonts/glyphs, the fix is to
open your C:\Program Files\Shared Files\Gtk\2.0\etc\gtk-2.0\gtkrc and to add this:
	style "user-font"
	{
	font_name="Arial"
	}
	widget_class "*" style "user-font"
This forces GTK+ to use a compatible font (Arial) and reportedly fixes both
the aforementioned problems, and probably others too.

3°) If you are getting any errors with DLLs, such as "The procedure entry point
atk_relation_set_add_relation_by_type could not be located in the dynamic link
library libatk-1.0-0.dll", make sure you have one and only ONE version of the
GTK+ DLLs. If unsure, remove all GTK+ packages and install it again.

4°) This setup will:
- copy USB drivers into C:\Program Files\{Common Files}\LPG Shared\drivers\usb,
- and register them into the Plug&Play database.

Simply plug your link cable: Windows should detect a new device and automatically
install it.

Please note these drivers are not compatible with Ti-Connnect(tm).

5°) This setup will install the DhaHelper driver for Windows NT4/2000/XP machines.
This step may require an administrator account (at least for NT4).
You may need to REBOOT your machine after installation (if you plan to 
use a parallel or serial link cable).

DhaHelper is copyrighted (c) 2004 Sascha Sommer and released under GPL license.
Source code is available from <http://svn.mplayerhq.hu/mplayer/trunk/vidix/dhahelperwin/>.

6°) The tiemu3-nogdb setup will install the GNU's 'wget' utility for download of GTK+
(http://xoomer.virgilio.it/hherold/).

7°) This setup will install/update the TiLP framework (libti* and drivers) which is
installed as shared components since TiLP v1.07, TiEmu v3.01 or GFM v1.00. 
Any software using the TiLP framework will take advantage of this update.

USAGE
-----

The installer automatically creates program entries in the Windows Startup menu.
