Previous version: 3.02		(21/12/2007)
Current version:  3.03		(08/05/2009)

SubVersion (CVS) revision: $Id: RELEASE 2042 2006-05-07 07:46:23Z roms $

TiEmu is available for 3 platforms:
Linux (GTK), Windows (GTK), Mac OS X (GTK)

[ In order to use TI's BlackLink serial cables or home-made serial or parallel
cables on any NT-based version of Windows (Windows NT 4, Windows 2000, Windows
XP, Windows 2003 or any newer version of Windows), you'll need to install the
DhaHelper driver. The installer for TiEmu 3 without GDB installs this driver
automatically. The installer for TiEmu 3 with GDB currently doesn't. ]

An easy way to install the above drivers is to install TiLP 2 for Windows.
For the other link cables / operating systems, no driver is needed.
